# ECSE 427 Project 1 (Fall 2021)

## Description
In this project, a shell interface is implemented that accepts user commands and executes each command in a **separate process**. 
The shell program provides a command prompt, where the user inputs a line of command. 
The shell is responsible for executing the command. The shell program assumes that the first string of the line gives the name of the executable file. 
The remaining strings in the line are considered as arguments for the command. Furthermore, **piping** and **output redirection** are also implemented in this project.
